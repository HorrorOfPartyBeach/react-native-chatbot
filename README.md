# **Daisy - React Native Chatbot**

**Introducing Daisy, a restaurant suggestions app.** 

This is the React Native platform which was built for the bot-framework chatbot, Daisy. Daisy stands for Delicious Artificially Intelligent Suggestions from Yelp.

Daisy was the graduating project from Northcoders coding bootcamp and was built by me (Emma), Annas, Sally, Matt and Paul. Our initial MVP was a chatbot deployed in Facebook which delivered a suggestion for a single restaurant when asked the question "Daisy, find me pizza in Manchester". After acheiving our MVP early in our 2 week timeframe, we expanded it to return a carousel of 5 cards with venue details from the Yelp API. If the first 5 didn't appeal to the user, they could request the next 5 and so on. We also deployed it in Slack and decided to build a React Native independent version which is what the code in this repo is. I took the lead on this and learned React Native and Gifted Chat UI in a week to achieve this.
